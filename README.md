# Medical MCP Server

[![Trust Score](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/api/badge/quality/JamesANZ/medical-mcp)](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/jamesanz__medical-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive medical information by querying multiple authoritative medical APIs including FDA, WHO, PubMed, and RxNorm.

## 🔒 Security Features

**Localhost-Only Binding**: This server is configured for maximum security with localhost-only access:

- **Stdio Mode (Default)**: Inherently localhost-only process communication
- **HTTP Mode**: Binds to `127.0.0.1` only, blocks all external connections
- **IP Filtering**: Validates all incoming connections against localhost addresses
- **CORS Restrictions**: Only allows localhost origins
- **Security Logging**: All blocked connection attempts are logged

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security configuration.

## 🔒 Security Verification

### **Test Localhost Access**

```bash
# Should work (localhost)
curl http://localhost:3000/info

# Should be blocked (external IP)
curl http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP:3000/info
# Returns: "Access denied: This server is restricted to localhost only"
```

### **Check Binding**

```bash
# Verify server is bound to localhost only
netstat -an | grep :3000
# Should show: 127.0.0.1:3000 (not 0.0.0.0:3000)
